This is the repository for the Matlab code used in the article 'Stranding ahoy? Heterogeneous transition beliefs and capital investment choices', authored by Louison Cahen-Fourot, Emanuele Campiglio, Louis Daumas, Michael Miess and Andrew Yardley. Current version: December 2022. 

To run the model, two files are needed: 
- Run file: isolates sensitivity variables to generate sensitivity plots. It calls the function file. Open this file to run the model.
- Function file: contains the full model, including calibration.

The 'Figure_codes' folder contains the code to create the figures used in the paper (called by the Run file). 

Finally, the 'Figure Archive' file includes deprecated code chunks for figure generation - conserved for archive
